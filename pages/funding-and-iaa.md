## How 18F is funded:

18F is a 100 percent cost-recoverable organization. The [General
Services Administration
(GSA)](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100000) funds 18F through the
[Acquisition Services Fund](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/182815),
which allows for investment in the development and delivery of products
and tools that will be used by other agencies on a reimbursable basis.
We can also work with agencies’ partners for reimbursement via the ASF
authority. Like many other government offices funded by revolving funds,
we must collect payment for all the work we do.

18F recovers costs through one of two authorities. We use the
Acquisition Services Fund reimbursement authority for work related to
acquisitions and the [Economy Act](http://www.gc.noaa.gov/documents/mou-economyact.pdf) reimbursement
authority for all projects that cannot use ASF reimbursement authority.
Once we have an interagency agreement (IAA) in place with an agency, we
bill on a quarterly basis through Intra-Governmental Payment and
Collection
([IPAC](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsservices/gov/acctg/ipac/ipac_home.htm)).

Project cost varies substantially according to the planned scope and
relies on factors unique to your agency and project. During your intake
meeting, we’ll provide specifics about our rates and the factors that
may impact cost.

Because of the statutes that govern our funding, we must charge for our
services to cover all of our labor, overhead, and other costs, and we
can only accept projects that have available funding. We also have
special fiscal year limitations that may be unfamiliar to those who have
worked closely with industry vendors. Ask yourself these questions to
help determine whether you are ready to draft an Interagency Agreement
with 18F.

-   Do you know the expiration date of your funds?
-   Are you prepared for a scenario where the burn-rate on the IAA is higher than expected?
-   Are you prepared for a scenario where the burn-rate on the IAA is lower than expected (and where you may have leftover funds at the end of a fiscal year?)

We are happy to answer your questions on this as we discuss your
challenges and how 18F can help.

## A few notes on Interagency Agreements (IAAs)

Before we can begin work with your agency, we’ll need to complete an
**Interagency Agreement (IAA)** with you. An IAA, in extremely broad
terms, is a legal document that outlines the nature of the work 18F will
undertake with your agency.

Each IAA has two major components:

-   A set of **General Terms and Conditions**, which outlines the relationship between agencies.
-   One or more **Order Requirements and Funding Information** documents. Each of these documents outlines a project’s statement of work, proposed cost, and performance period.

In most cases, completing the IAA process takes about four weeks, and
18F will take the first step by drafting a statement of work for your
agency’s review.
