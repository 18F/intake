18Fâ€™s Infrastructure Services team provides agencies with industry-leading infrastructure and software services through Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).

### 18F Infrastructure Services is:

* A way to obtain industry leading infrastructure and software services quickly.
* A mechanism to sell on demand at fixed-unit prices.
* A pre-competed service that is currently in very high demand but is still faster than traditional procurement processes.

### We currently offer infrastructure and software solutions for:

* Cloud hosting and infrastructure as a service (for example: Amazon Web Services)
* Content delivery networks (for example: Akamai, AWS CloudFront)
* Voice and messaging orchestration (for example: Twilio)
* Continuous monitoring (for example: Splunk)
* Application performance monitoring (for example: New Relic)


We have developed a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) called cloud.gov, based on the open source Cloud Foundry. This allows partners to create a platform where developers can deploy applications without having to worry about how their applications are run or what hardening measures are in place.

18F Infrastructure *doesn't* provide operations and maintenance (O&M) support beyond that which comes with the external service. As the partner, you're free to select the optimal provider for the type of O&M support you need.

Through an Interagency Agreement (IAA), you can use the BPA we've already created and used for these same services, avoiding the cost and time required for a fresh procurement.

18F Infrastructure allows you to focus on designing and implementing an intelligent infrastructure that meets your dynamic digital needs.
