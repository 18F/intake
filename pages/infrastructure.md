## 18F Infrastructure

18Fâ€™s Infrastructure Services team provides agencies with industry-leading infrastructure and software services through Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).

#### 18F Infrastructure Services is:

* a way to obtain industry leading infrastructure and software services quickly
* a mechanism to sell on demand at fixed-unit prices
* a pre-competed service that is currently in very high demand but is still faster than traditional procurement processes

##### We currently offer infrastructure and software solutions for:

* cloud hosting/infrastructure as a service (for example: Amazon Web Services)
* content delivery networks (for example: Akamai, AWS CloudFront)
* voice and messaging orchestration (for example: Twilio)
* continuous monitoring (for example: Splunk)
* application performance monitoring (for example: New Relic)

18F Infrastructure *doesn't* provide operations and maintenance (O&M) support beyond that which comes with the external service. As the partner, you're free to select the optimal provider for the type of O&M support you need.

Through an Interagency Agreement (IAA), you can use the BPA we've already created and used for these same services, avoiding the cost and time required for a fresh procurement.

18F Infrastructure allows you to focus on designing and implementing an intelligent infrastructure that meets your dynamic digital needs.
