18F’s Infrastructure Services team provides agencies with **industry-leading infrastructure and software services** through [Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs)](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100643). By partnering with 18F Infrastructure, your agency will be able to quickly acquire services at fixed-unit prices from 18F’s pre-competed service. 

18F Infrastructure also provides associated consultative and operational labor, including cost tracking, billing, and consultative assistance to inform your infrastructure management and ensure your services meet federal compliance requirements. This support allows you to focus on **designing and implementing an intelligent infrastructure** that meets your dynamic digital needs.

We also have a Platform-as-a-Service product line called [cloud.gov](cloud.gov) based on open source Cloud Foundry. Cloud.gov allows partners to create a platform where developers can deploy applications without having to worry about how their applications are run or what hardening measures are in place.

### What We Offer

* Cloud hosting and infrastructure as a service
* Content delivery networks
* Voice and messaging orcestration
* Continuous Monitoring
* Application performance monitoring

Cost estimates for services will vary depending on labor required for provisioning a compliant service and cost recovery for acquisition.

18F Infrastructure *doesn't* provide operations and maintenance (O&M) support beyond that which comes with the external service. As the partner, you're free to select the optimal provider for the type of O&M support you need.
