title: Introducing 18F
---

18F is a civic consultancy *for* the government *inside* the government working with agencies to rapidly deploy tools and services that are easy to use, cost efficient, and reusable. Our goal is to change how the government buys and develops digital services by helping agencies adopt modern techniques that deliver superior products.

We're transforming government from the inside out, creating **cultural change** by working with teams inside agencies who want to create great services for the public.

##### We will accomplish our mission by:
* Putting the needs of the public first
* Being design-centric, agile, open, and data-driven
* Deploying tools and services early and often

18F is a startup inside the General Services Administration. We are part of the [Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729).
