title: Get to know 18F
---

18F is a civic digital consultancy *for* the government *inside* the
government. Our goal is to change how the government buys and develops
digital services by helping agencies adopt modern, agile, user-centered
techniques. We work with agencies to rapidly deploy tools and services
that are easy to use, cost efficient, and driven by user need; whenever
possible, we create solutions that can be reused by other agencies and
organizations.

We also offer workshops and consulting services to help your team more
effectively manage and deliver digital services. experts can also offer
advice on buying digital services from private vendors and increasing
the skills of your in-house team.

## We accomplish our mission by:

-   Putting the needs of users first
-   Being design-centric, agile, open, and data-driven
-   Deploying tools and services early and often

18F is formally a part of the [Office of Citizen Services and
Innovative Technologies](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729)/18F
within the General Services Administration. Weâ€™re a 100 percent cost
recoverable organization. To read more about our cost-recoverable
