title: Interested in working with 18F?
---
Our intake process is itself an iterative project. We wrote [this blog post] (https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/09/18/getting-to-work-for-the-american-people/) in September 2014; since then, we’ve continued to iterate as we’ve learned from various projects about good questions to ask up front.

## What are we looking for?

* Impact on the public
* Core principles
  * Understanding of Agile
    * Our solutions often start small---we create **minimal-viable products (MVPs)** then begin to add onto something once we’ve verified the core architecture of the solution against users.
    * We then develop new features and pieces using “sprints” that work to iterate and complete new pieces of the software regularly.
  * Understanding of user-centered research and design
  * Understanding of open source
    * Our projects are on our Github, where anyone can copy the code for their own project. This enables members of the public to help beta test and helps with transparency, good code, etc.
* Strong product owner
* To have an exit strategy

### Email inquiries18f@gsa.gov with your need and we'll be happy to talk further.
