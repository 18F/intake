title: Interested in working with 18F?
---

Our intake process is itself an iterative project. We wrote [this blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/09/18/getting-to-work-for-the-american-people/) in September 2014; since then, we’ve continued to iterate as we’ve learned from various projects about good questions to ask up front.

### What are we looking for?

* Impact on the public
* Core principles
  * Understanding of Agile
    * Our solutions often start small — we create **minimal-viable products (MVPs)** then begin to add onto something once we’ve verified the core architecture of the solution against users.
    * We then develop new features and pieces using “sprints” that work to iterate and complete new pieces of the software regularly.
  * Understanding of user-centered research and design
  * Understanding of open source
    * Our projects are hosted on our GitHub account, where anyone can copy the code for their own project. This enables members of the public to help beta test and helps with transparency, good code, etc.
* Strong product owner

### We are cost recoverable. 
We are 100% cost recoverable per the statutes that govern our funding.  We also have special fiscal year limitations that may be seem unfamiliar to those who have worked closely with industry vendors.  We are happy to answer your questions on this as we discuss your challenges and how 18F can help. 

####What does this mean for you?
18F’s requirement to be cost-recoverable means that we have to take on projects with available funding.

####How do you know if you’re ready to set up an IAA with 18F?
* Do you know the expiration date of your funds?
* Are you prepared for a scenario where the burn-rate on the IAA is higher than expected?
* Are you prepared for a scenario where the burn-rate on the IAA is lower than expected (and where you may have leftover funds at the end of a fiscal year?)


##### Email inquiries18f@gsa.gov with your need and we'll be happy to talk further.
