title: Explaining 18F's intake process

### Intake Process

Let's talk! This page walks you through our intake process so you know what to expect.

#### Preliminary

First, please email us at [inquiries18f.gsa.gov](mailto:inquiries18f.gsa.gov). Include this information in your note:

  * The name of your agency
  * A brief description of your project or the challenge you are trying to solve.
  * Dates and times you're available for a 45 minute introductory call in the next two weeks. 

We'll get back to you within 1-3 business days.

#### Investigation and Decision

During the introductory call with the Intake Team, we’ll tell you more about 18F, our history, our lines of business, and [how we work](https://pages.18f.gov/Partnership-Playbook/). Afterward, we’ll direct your inquiry to the appropriate business lines (Delivery, Consulting, Infrastructure, Talent) for further discussion on resources, timing and if 18F is the right partner for the challenge.

Once we bring in a technical team, you can expect one or more “deep dive” meetings as we evaluate the resources that would be needed, and move through a process of understanding the problem. Sometimes we will recommend a workshop with users to take a look at the problem directly (this might happen before we scope the project).

#### Live Project

When we have a match:

   * The product lead will work with you to scope the Statement of Work.
   * Our contracting team will work with you to set up the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or Interagency Agreement (IAA).
