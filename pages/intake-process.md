##Explaining 18F's Intake Process

###Intake Process

* You contact 18F at inquiries18f.gsa.gov
* Introductory Call
  * Learn more about 18F - how we were created and how we work
  * Tell 18F Intake Team about the problem you are trying to solve
* Triage - Intake Team will triage after introductory call in consultation with business lines
  * Once we bring in a technical team, you can expect several rounds of meetings as we move through a process of understanding your problem, with each meeting getting deeper into the problem.
  * Sometimes we will recommend a workshop with users where we take a look at the problem directly (this might happen before the IAA)
* Evaluation of resource needs
* The 18F IAA team begins work with you to set-up the paperwork!
