---

###Intake Process

* You contact 18F at [inquiries18f.gsa.gov](mailto:inquiries18f.gsa.gov) with your agency, a brief description of your product, and times you're available for a brief call in the next couple weeks. 
* Introductory call
  * Learn more about 18F â€” how we were created and how we work.
  * Tell the 18F Intake Team about the problem you're trying to solve.
* The Intake Team will direct your inquiry to the appropriate business line or business lines. 
  * Once we bring in a technical team, you can expect several rounds of meetings as we move through a process of understanding your problem, with each meeting getting deeper into the problem.
  * Sometimes we will recommend a workshop with users where we take a look at the problem directly (this might happen before the IAA).
* Evaluation of resource needs
* The 18F IAA team begins work with you to set-up the paperwork!
