### More about 18F Intake

* Once we bring in a technical team, you can expect several rounds of meetings as we move through a process of understanding your problem, with each meeting getting deeper into the problem.
* One of our core principles is user-centered research and design, so sometimes we will recommend a workshop with users where we take a look at the problem directly.
