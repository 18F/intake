## Cost and IAA Details

### How 18F is funded:

18F is a cost-recoverable organization. We rely mostly on the following two channels for funding our work.

* GSA funds 18F through the [Acquisition Services Fund] (http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/182815), which allows for investment in the development and delivery of products and tools that will be used by other agencies on a reimbursable basis.
* The Economy Act allows 18F to be reimbursed for services provided to other agencies. Once an agreement is in place, we bill on a quarterly basis through [IPACS] (https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsservices/gov/acctg/ipac/ipac_home.htm).
