We can provide your team with the skills and knowledge they need to
modernize your agency’s digital services. We’ve also built a number of
knowledge-sharing and documentation tools for 18F’s own use that you can
copy and use at your agency. We can help you:

-   Run a workshop on agile software development, like the [Lego workshop we did with the Small Business Administration](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/08/31/how-playing-with-legos-taught-executives-agile/) or the longer one we did with the [Social Security Administration](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/02/11/a-story-of-an-agile-workshop/).
-   Host a design studio, like we did with the [Department of the Interior](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/09/25/design-studio-onrr/).
-   Create your own lightweight knowledge sharing platform based off 18F’s [Guides](https://pages.18f.gov/guides-template/) and [Pages](https://pages.18f.gov/) projects.
