We believe federal IT acquisitions can be faster, cheaper, and produce
better results. If your agency is developing a new request for quotation
for IT services or is interested in innovative ways to buy technology,
our team is excited to work with you. We can help you:

-   Write agile, modular, and user-centered design into your request for quotations through our RFP Ghostwriting service, like we did with the [Department of Health and Human Services](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/03/22/helping-california-buy-a-new-child-welfare-system/).
-   Develop a marketplace to buy IT services using modern techniques, like we did with the [Agile Blanket Purchase Agreement](https://pages.18f.gov/ads-bpa/).
-   Buy small pieces of open source code to advance your projects, like weâ€™re doing with our [micro-purchase platform](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/).
