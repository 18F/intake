If your agency’s project has a digital component, 18F’s team of software
developers, visual designers, writers, and security experts can help you
build it. We can also help ensure that you are set up to get the most
value out of the solutions we offer. We can help you:

-   Improve a challenging user process by reimagining a daunting task, as we did with the [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service](https://my.uscis.gov/) and their immigration and visa processes
-   Build a new site and API to showcase and synthesize data from multiple sources, as we did with Department of Education's [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/)
-   Help you make your data more accessible with a user-friendly site and developer tools, as we did with the [Federal Election Commission](https://beta.fec.gov/)
-   Build web-based tools to streamline internal agency processes, as we did with [Communicart](https://cap.18f.gov/) and [CALC](https://calc.gsa.gov/)
-   Scope a solution or collaborate on an idea in a way that empowers you to meet the needs of your users, as we did with the [Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/09/how-a-two-day-spring-moved-an-agency-twenty-years-forward/)
-   Do user research and discovery sprints to promote a new digital model that houses information, as we did with NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Discovery project
