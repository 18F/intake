title: Welcome to the 18F Intake site
navtitle: Introduction
---

Intake is the process by which 18F listens to potential partners,
discusses possible solutions to your challenges, and figures out what to
do next. In short, it’s how we do business development. Please note that due to how our funding mechanisms work, we can only execute on formal work with federal or DC gov't partners.

### Our Process

Our intake process is itself an iterative project. We wrote [this blog
post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/09/18/getting-to-work-for-the-american-people/)
detailing our process in September 2014; since then, we’ve continued to
modify our approach as we’ve learned from various projects about good
questions to ask up front. For example, [we've published the 18F
Delivery Partnership
Playbook](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/11/19/delivery-partnership-playbook/)
to outline up front some of the 18F values that come up in our process,
and we've added extra steps to our intake discussions with you to make
sure we leave the process with all the information we need for an IAA.

#### Will Slack, Business Strategy Deputy Director

Will faciliates project intake at 18F.

In his words: "My job is to help 18F continue to take on great projects as we grow by managing how we represent 18F to potential partners and then represent those possible projects to 18F. I also look at everything from our competiting priorities to how we position ourselves within GSA and the wider Digital Coalition. Besides facilitating intake, I help across the board with bureaucracy hacking, documentation, and other projects."
