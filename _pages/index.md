title: Welcome to the 18F Intake site
navtitle: Introduction
---

Intake is the process by which 18F listens to potential partners, discusses possible solutions to your challenges, and determines appropriate next steps. In short, it’s how we do business development for inbound inquiries. Please note that due to how our funding mechanisms work, we must be funded by federal or DC government dollars.

### Our Process

Our intake process is itself an iterative project. We wrote [this blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/09/18/getting-to-work-for-the-american-people/) detailing our process in September 2014; since then, we’ve continued to modify our approach as we’ve learned from various projects about good questions to ask up front. For example, [we've published the 18F Partnership Playbook](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/11/19/delivery-partnership-playbook/) to outline up front some of the 18F values that come up in our process, and we've added extra steps to our intake discussions with you to make sure we leave the process with all the information we need for an IAA.
