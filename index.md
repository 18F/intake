title: Welcome to the 18F Intake site
---

Intake is the process by which 18F listens to potential partners,
discusses possible solutions to your challenges, and figures out what to
do next. In short, it’s how we do business development.

### Our Process

Our intake process is itself an iterative project. We wrote [this blog
post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/09/18/getting-to-work-for-the-american-people/)
detailing our process in September 2014; since then, we’ve continued to
modify our approach as we’ve learned from various projects about good
questions to ask up front. For example, [we've published the 18F
Delivery Partnership
Playbook](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/11/19/delivery-partnership-playbook/)
to outline up front some of the 18F values that come up in our process,
and we've added extra steps to our intake discussions with you to make
sure we leave the process with all the information we need for an IAA.

Will is building the infrastructure for project intake at 18F.

In his words: "My job is to figure out the most effective ways 18F can continue to do good work and grow. I look at everything from the projects we choose to take on to how we position ourselves within GSA and the USDS family. I touch all projects coming into delivery but also help across the board with documentation, onboarding, and other projects."
