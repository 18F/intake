Intake is the process by which 18F listens to potential partners,
discusses possible solutions to your challenges, and figures out what to
do next. In short, it’s how we do business development. Intake is run by
the Business Strategy team, which includes [Will
Slack](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/will/) and [Stephanie
Rivera](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/stephanierivera/).

Our intake process is itself an iterative project. We wrote [this blog
post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/09/18/getting-to-work-for-the-american-people/)
detailing our process in September 2014; since then, we’ve continued to
modify our approach as we’ve learned from various projects about good
questions to ask up front. For example, [we've published the 18F
Delivery Partnership
Playbook](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/11/19/delivery-partnership-playbook/)
to outline up front some of the 18F values that come up in our process,
and we've added extra steps to our intake discussions with you to make
sure we leave the process with all the information we need for an IAA.

This site will walk you through our intake process and how we work.
